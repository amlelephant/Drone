# Custom Drone

This project took quite a long time and is currently still in the making. Since most of the software side is all parameters on mission planner, this repo will be mostly to store the physical components. Since this is also being created after the fact (I forgot to upload this) the version system is a little off since I did not locally download each version of the body. The ones with the highest version are the correct ones though. The biggest problem with creating custom drones is by far the paramaters. I won't put my parameter file on here because it is simply useless for someone trying to recreate my project. The parameters depending on what you build it out of and how weight is distributed would be completely different than mine. My build consisted of a raspberry pi zero, speedy bee f405 v4, and some basic amazon motors. The other components can be found on the hand drawn schematics. The drone folder contains a little tester code for possible usages I have been working on. (STEP files are downloaded and used for demension checking and building on onshape)
